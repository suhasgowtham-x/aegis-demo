User: How do I deploy a secure Flask app?
AEGIS: To deploy a secure Flask app, you can follow these steps:

1. Utilize a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI to serve your Flask application.
2. Set up a reverse proxy using a web server like Nginx or Apache to handle incoming client requests and forward them to the WSGI server.
3. Configure TLS/SSL certificates to enable HTTPS for secure communication between the client and the server. You can use Let's Encrypt to obtain free SSL certificates.
4. Implement security best practices in your Flask app, such as input validation, secure coding practices, and protecting against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
5. Ensure your server and dependencies are regularly updated to patch any security vulnerabilities.
6. Consider using tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and web application firewalls (WAF) for additional security measures.
7. Monitor logs and metrics to detect and respond to any security incidents promptly.
